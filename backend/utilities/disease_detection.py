The extent to which gray leaf spot damages crop yields can be estimated based on the extent to which leaves are infected relative to grain fill. Damage can be more severe when developing lesions progress past the ear leaf around pollination time. Because a decrease in functioning leaf area limits photosynthates dedicated towards grainfill, the plant might mobilize more carbohydrates from the stalk to fill kernels.

        <br/><br/>1. The black rot fungus overwinters in canes, tendrils, and leaves on the grape vine and on the ground. Mummified berries on the ground or those that are still clinging to the vines become the major infection source the following spring.
        <br/><br/>2. During rain, microscopic spores (ascospores) are shot out of numerous, black fruiting bodies (perithecia) and are carried by air currents to young, expanding leaves. In the presence of moisture, these spores germinate in 36 to 48 hours and eventually penetrate the leaves and fruit stems.
        <br/><br/>3. The infection becomes visible after 8 to 25 days. When the weather is wet, spores can be released the entire spring and summer providing continuous infection.
        <br/><br/><b><i>How to prevent/cure the disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Space vines properly and choose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation. Keep the vines off the ground and insure they are properly tied, limiting the amount of time the vines remain wet thus reducing infection.
        <br/><br/>2. Keep the fruit planting and surrounding areas free of weeds and tall grass. This practice will promote lower relative humidity and rapid drying of vines and thereby limit fungal infection.
        <br/><br/>3. Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set.""",

The overwintering structures that produce spores (perithecia or pycnidia, depending on the pathogen) are embedded in diseased woody parts of vines.
        <br/><br/>3. During fall to spring rainfall, spores are released and wounds made by dormant pruning provide infection sites.
        <br/><br/>4. Wounds may remain susceptible to infection for several weeks after pruning with susceptibility declining over time.
        <br/><br/><b><i>How to prevent/cure the disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Post-infection practices (sanitation and vine surgery) for use in diseased, mature vineyards are not as effective and are far more costly than adopting preventative practices (delayed pruning, double pruning, and applications of pruning-wound protectants) in young vineyards.
        <br/><br/>2. Sanitation and vine surgery may help maintain yields. In spring, look for dead spurs or for stunted shoots. Later in summer, when there is a reduced chance of rainfall, practice good sanitation by cutting off these cankered portions of the vine beyond the canker, to where wood appears healthy. Then remove diseased, woody debris from the vineyard and destroy it.
        <br/><br/>3. The fungicides labeled as pruning-wound protectants, consider using alternative materials, such as a wound sealant with 5 percent boric acid in acrylic paint (Tech-Gro B-Lock), which is effective against Eutypa dieback and Esca, or an essential oil (Safecoat VitiSeal).""",

        <br/><br/><b><i>Disease:</i></b> Late Blight: Late blight is a potentially devastating disease of tomato, infecting leaves, stems and fruits of plants. The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated.              
        <br/><br/><b><i>Cause of disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms also called water molds, but they are not true fungi.
        <br/><br/>2. There are many different strains of P. infestans. These are called clonal lineages and designated by a number code (i.e. US-23). Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or the other.
        <br/><br/>3. The host range is typically limited to potato and tomato, but hairy nightshade (Solanum physalifolium) is a closely related weed that can readily become infected and may contribute to disease spread. Under ideal conditions, such as a greenhouse, petunia also may become infected.""",
    "Tomato___Leaf_Mold": """<b><i>Crop:</i></b> Tomato
        <br/><br/><b><i>Disease:</i></b> Leaf Mold
        <br/><br/><b><i>Cause of disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Leaf mold is caused by the fungus Passalora fulva (previously called Fulvia fulva or Cladosporium fulvum). It is not known to be pathogenic on any plant other than tomato.
        <br/><br/>2. Leaf spots grow together and turn brown. Leaves wither and die but often remain attached to the plant.
        <br/><br/>3. Fruit infections start as a smooth black irregular area on the stem end of the fruit. As the disease progresses, the infected area becomes sunken, dry and leathery.
        <br/><br/><b><i>How to prevent/cure the disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Use drip irrigation and avoid watering foliage.
        <br/><br/>2. Space plants to provide good air movement between rows and individual plants.
        <br/><br/>3. Stake, string or prune to increase airflow in and around the plant.
        <br/><br/>4. Sterilize stakes, ties, trellises etc. with 10 percent household bleach or commercial sanitizer.
        <br/><br/>5. Circulate air in greenhouses or tunnels with vents and fans and by rolling up high tunnel sides to reduce humidity around plants.
        <br/><br/>6. Keep night temperatures in greenhouses higher than outside temperatures to avoid dew formation on the foliage.
        <br/><br/>7. Remove crop residue at the end of the season. Burn it or bury it away from tomato production areas.""",

        <br/><br/>Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods.
        <br/><br/><b><i>How to prevent/cure the disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Remove diseased leaves.
        <br/><br/>2. Improve air circulation around the plants.

        <br/><br/>1. The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops.
        <br/><br/>2. They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions.
        <br/><br/>3. Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies that help to manage mite populations. 
        <br/><br/><b><i>How to prevent/cure the disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.
        <br/><br/>2. Do not over-fertilize.

        <br/><br/><b><i>Disease:</i></b> Target Spot
        <br/><br/><b><i>Cause of disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. The fungus causes plants to lose their leaves; it is a major disease. If infection occurs before the fruit has developed, yields are low.
        <br/><br/>2. This is a common disease on tomato in Pacific island countries. The disease occurs in the screen house and in the field.
        <br/><br/><b><i>How to prevent/cure the disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base.
        <br/><br/>2. Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
        <br/><br/>3. Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.

        <br/><br/>1. TYLCV is transmitted by the insect vector Bemisia tabaci in a persistent-circulative nonpropagative manner. The virus can be efficiently transmitted during the adult stages.
        <br/><br/>2. This virus transmission has a short acquisition access period of 15–20 minutes, and latent period of 8–24 hours.
        <br/><br/><b><i>How to prevent/cure the disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Currently, the most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties.
        <br/><br/>2. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide the most effective treatment against virus transmission.
        <br/><br/>3. Other methods to control the spread of TYLCV include planting resistant/tolerant lines, crop rotation, and breeding for resistance of TYLCV. As with many other plant viruses, one of the most promising methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV.""",

        <br/><br/><b><i>Disease:</i></b> Mosaic Virus
        <br/><br/><b><i>Cause of disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Tomato mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus can exist for two years in dry soil or leaf debris, but will only persist one month if soil is moist. The viruses can also survive in infected root debris in the soil for up to two years.
        <br/><br/>2. Seed can be infected and pass the virus to the plant but the disease is usually introduced and spread primarily through human activity. The virus can easily spread between plants on workers' hands, tools, and clothes with normal activities such as plant tying, removing of suckers, and harvest.
        <br/><br/>3. The virus can even survive the tobacco curing process, and can spread from cigarettes and other tobacco products to plant material handled by workers after a cigarette.
        <br/><br/><b><i>How to prevent/cure the disease:</i></b>
        <br/><br/>1. Purchase transplants only from reputable sources. Ask about the sanitation procedures they use to prevent disease.
        <br/><br/>2. Inspect transplants prior to purchase. Choose only transplants showing no clear symptoms.      
        <br/><br/>3. Avoid planting in fields where tomato root debris is present, as the virus can survive long-term in roots.
        <br/><br/>4. Wash hands with soap and water before and during the handling of plants to reduce potential spread between plants.""",
