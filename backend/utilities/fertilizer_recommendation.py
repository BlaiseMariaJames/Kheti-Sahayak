            <br/><br/>1. <b><i>Manure:</i></b> Add manure to amend your soil with nitrogen, but be cautious about the type of manure, as nitrogen levels can vary.
            <br/><br/>2. <b><i>Coffee grounds:</i></b> Use coffee grounds as a green compost material rich in nitrogen. It improves soil drainage as it breaks down.
            <br/><br/>3. <b><i>Plant nitrogen-fixing plants:</i></b> Grow vegetables like peas, beans, and soybeans from the Fabaceae family to increase nitrogen in the soil.
            <br/><br/>4. <b><i>Plant 'green manure' crops:</i></b> Consider crops like cabbage, corn, and broccoli to enhance nitrogen content.
            <br/><br/>5. <b><i>Use wet grass mulch:</i></b> Apply mulch, including wet grass, sawdust, and softwoods, during crop growth to improve nitrogen levels.

            <br/><br/>1. <b><i>Add sawdust or fine wood chips:</i></b> These carbon-rich materials absorb excess nitrogen.

            <br/><br/>3. <b><i>Water:</i></b> Soak your soil to leach nitrogen deeper into the soil.
            <br/><br/>4. <b><i>Sugar:</i></b> Limited studies suggest that adding sugar may reduce nitrogen in the soil, as sugar contains carbon that attracts and absorbs nitrogen.
            <br/><br/>5. <b><i>Add composted manure:</i></b> Improve nitrogen levels by incorporating composted manure into the soil.
            <br/><br/>6. <b><i>Plant nitrogen-fixing plants:</i></b> Include peas or beans in your planting to increase nitrogen.
            <br/><br/>7. <b><i>Use high N value NPK fertilizers:</i></b> Consider fertilizers with high nitrogen content.
            <br/><br/>8. <b><i>Do nothing:</i></b> If your plants are thriving, letting them absorb nitrogen may be the best strategy.

            <br/><br/>2. <b><i>Use only phosphorus-free fertilizer:</i></b> Choose fertilizers with numbers like 10-0-10, where the zero indicates no phosphorus.
            <br/><br/>3. <b><i>Water your soil:</i></b> Soak your soil to drive phosphorus out. This is a last resort.
            <br/><br/>4. <b><i>Plant nitrogen-fixing vegetables:</i></b> Increase nitrogen without raising phosphorus by planting beans and peas.

            <br/><br/>3. <b><i>Phosphorus fertilizers:</i></b> Use fertilizers with high phosphorus content in the NPK ratio (e.g., 10-20-10).
            <br/><br/>4. <b><i>Organic compost:</i></b> Add quality organic compost to increase phosphorus content.
            <br/><br/>5. <b><i>Manure:</i></b> Incorporate manure into the soil for a phosphorus boost.
            <br/><br/>6. <b><i>Clay soil:</i></b> Introduce clay particles to fix phosphorus deficiencies.
            <br/><br/>7. <b><i>Ensure proper soil pH:</i></b> Maintain a pH in the 6.0 to 7.0 range for optimal phosphorus uptake.
            <br/><br/>8. <b><i>Adjust pH with lime or potassium carbonate:</i></b> Add lime or potassium carbonate if pH is low, or organic matter if pH is high.
