## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Kheti Sahayak

To get started with the Kheti Sahayak project, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed on your computer. 

You will also need a [Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com/) to store images.

You can clone the current version of the project from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BlaiseMariaJames/Kheti-Sahayak) and install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/BlaiseMariaJames/Kheti-Sahayak.git
cd Kheti-Sahayak
npm install
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you have to create an .env file with the following environment variables:

Name and secret for Session (Optional):

```
SESSION_NAME='<your_session_name>'
SESSION_SECRET='<your_session_secret>'
```

Your cloudinary account credentials (Required):

Once all variables are declared, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block:

```
conda create -n khetisahayak python=3.6.12
conda activate khetisahayak
pip install -r ./backend/requirements.txt
```

With mongod running behind, now you can start the application by running the following command:
